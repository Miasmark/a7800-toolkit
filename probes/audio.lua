-- Log a running 7800 game's audio register writes, for tools/tracker.py.
--
--   TIA (every cartridge has one):
--     mame a7800 -cart game.a78 -autoboot_script probes/audio.lua \
--          -sound none -video none -str 40
--     python tools/tracker.py capture a7800-audio.log -o game.trk
--
--   POKEY (about a fifth of them; cart.py says which and where):
--     set A7800_POKEY to the base address first, e.g.
--     A7800_POKEY=0x0450 mame a7800 -cart game.a78 ...
--
-- Pass -sound none. The log is written from the emulation, not from the
-- speakers, so muting costs nothing -- and without it a -nothrottle run plays
-- the whole session at twenty times speed through your audio device.
--
-- The registers ARE the music: whatever the cartridge's player does to produce
-- them, the stream of writes is the same thing you would have to write
-- yourself. So this works on a game whose player has never been looked at.
--
-- One line per frame in which anything changed. TIA:
--     frame  c0 f0 v0  c1 f1 v1
-- POKEY:
--     frame  f1 c1  f2 c2  f3 c3  f4 c4  ctl
-- all hex. Frames where nothing changed are not logged; the tracker holds the
-- last value, which is what the chip does too.
--
-- KEEP THE TAPS IN A GLOBAL. A tap stored in a local is collected as soon as
-- the enclosing chunk finishes, and it stops firing without saying so -- which
-- looks exactly like a game that writes no audio.
