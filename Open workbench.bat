rem  Drag a cartridge onto this to open the workbench: what the header says,
rem  what a scan finds, and a button on each result that opens it in the right
rem  editor with the space, base and format already filled in.
rem
rem     .a78   a cartridge with a header   -> opens it
rem     .bin   a headerless dump           -> opens it, mapper guessed from size

rem  The page opens in your browser. Leave this window open while you work:
rem  closing it stops the workbench and every editor it launched, which is
rem  deliberate -- an editor left holding its port looks exactly like a stale
rem  server the next time you run one.
rem
rem  Set A7800_WORKBENCH_PORT to move it off 8120. The editors it launches take
rem  the ports above 8140.
rem
rem  Everything here is drag-and-drop-able:
rem     Open workbench.bat      this -- start here with an unfamiliar cartridge
rem     Open in tracker.bat     straight to the music
rem     Render dropped file.bat straight to a WAV
