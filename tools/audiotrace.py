"""
Find a cartridge's music by following the code that writes to the sound chip.

    python audiotrace.py game.a78 [-c annotations.json]

`tracker.py capture` records what a game plays while it runs. This does the
static half: it disassembles the ROM, finds every store to a TIA or POKEY audio
register, works backwards to whatever supplies the value, and reports the tables
it lands on. That is the part of "where is the music?" that otherwise costs an
afternoon of reading.

What it can do, and what it cannot:

  * **Locating the player** is reliable. Audio stores cluster tightly -- a music
    routine and a sound-effect routine are usually a few hundred bytes each and
    nowhere near each other -- so grouping the stores by address separates them
    without knowing anything about the game.

  * **Finding the tables** works whenever the value comes from an indexed load,
    which is how nearly every player is written: `LDA table,Y / STA AUDC0`. The
    table's address falls straight out. Where the load goes through a zero-page
    pointer instead, it follows one more hop to whatever fills that pointer,
    which is usually the pointer table itself.

  * **Reconstructing the song** is not attempted, and should be treated with
    suspicion wherever a tool claims it. Every player invents its own format:
    Midnight Mutants nests song -> track -> pattern -> note, four levels deep,
    with a duration index and an instrument packed into one byte. Nothing
    portable can guess that. What this gives you is the addresses and the bytes;
    the shape is yours to work out, and `tracker.py capture` is the way to check
    a guess against what the game actually plays.
