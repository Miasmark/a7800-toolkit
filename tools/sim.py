Run a cartridge's own code, and listen to what it writes to the sound chip.

    python tools/sim.py game.a78 --seconds 20 -o game.log
    python tools/sim.py game.a78 -o out.log --compare known-good.log

`capture.py` gets the same log by driving an emulator. This gets it by
executing the 6502 directly: RAM, the cartridge mapper, enough of MARIA to keep
a game's timing loop happy, and a trap on every write to TIA or POKEY.

The reason to have it is not to replace the emulator, which is better at being
an emulator. It is that **a player written for a format nobody has described is
still the authority on that format.** Reimplementing RMT's replayer means
reading 803 instructions and hoping; running it means the answer is correct by
construction. The same goes for every other player in the library.

## State: it works on a fixed score, and cannot be scored on a generated one

`--compare` scores the simulation against a capture from `capture.py`. Run
like for like -- same emulator, no input, long enough -- Midnight Mutants
reads:

    agreement  94.8%   of what it played is the capture's, in order
    progress  100.0%   it reached the end of the capture
    timing     1.00x   gaps between matched events

That is a 6502, a mapper, MARIA's display interrupts and a TIA player
reproducing forty seconds of a commercial game's music. For a cartridge that
plays a fixed score, this tool now does what it was built to do.

**It got there by fixing the measurement, not the simulator.** The same game
read 7.7% for a long time, on two mistakes that were mine rather than the
code's:

  * It was compared against a committed log that is not reproducible. A fresh
    no-input capture gives 456 states where that log has 818, and the two
    part company by frame 162 -- it was recorded with someone playing.
  * Every run was 14 seconds. The game leaves its attract loop at frame 1170,
    about 19.5 seconds, so no run had ever reached the music it was being
    marked against.

**Ballblazer cannot be scored this way at all**, and that is a fact about the
cartridge. It generates its music from POKEY's random number generator rather
than playing a score (see below), so a correct simulation with a different
random stream produces different, equally valid music. It reads 24% agreement
and the number is meaningless. Judge that one by whether it plays -- it does,
on all four voices, continuously.

## What is known to work

The 6502 core, the mapper and the memory map are right, and this is not an
opinion: diffed instruction by instruction against MAME's debugger trace (with
`noloop` -- see pitfalls.md), from the moment the BIOS hands over the
cartridge, **the first 427,399 instructions are identical**. That is about 124
frames.

MARIA's display interrupts are implemented -- the DLL the game builds in RAM
is walked each frame and an NMI raised at the end of every zone whose entry has
bit 7 set -- and the walk agrees with MAME byte for byte. They demonstrably
fire: early in Ballblazer this raises 16 a frame, and the game's counter at
`$40` counts down exactly once per frame, as its author intended.

## What stopped it: POKEY's random number generator

Traced to a root cause and fixed.

Ballblazer does not play a score, it **generates** one, and it asks POKEY for
the entropy. At `$B333`:

    CMP $400A        ; POKEY's RANDOM register
    BCS $B34A        ; skip this note if the comparison fails
    LDA $B936,Y
    STA $2123        ; otherwise emit it

This simulator returned zero for every POKEY read. `A >= 0` is always true, so
the branch always skipped, no note was ever emitted, and the four voice cells
the player reads stayed at zero. The player then did exactly what it was told
and played silence -- which is why the failure looked like a player that
stops, then like a missing interrupt, then like a display-list problem, and
was none of those.

`Bus.random` now implements the 17-bit polynomial counter, clocked at the CPU
rate. The music plays: 428 of 429 logged states carry voice four, against one
of 164 before, and it keeps playing to the end of the run instead of dying
around frame 400.

### And the score went DOWN

Agreement fell from 60% to 24% while the simulation became fundamentally more
correct, because a generated soundtrack driven by a different random stream is
different music -- valid, in the same style, not the same notes. **Ballblazer
cannot be scored by log comparison at all** unless the polynomial counter is
bit-exact and cycle-aligned with the hardware, which is a far higher bar than
"plays the right music".

That is a limit of the gate, not a defect in the fix, and it is worth stating
plainly because the number moving the wrong way is exactly what an unwary
reading would call a regression. For cartridges that play a fixed score the
comparison means what it says; for one that improvises, it cannot.

## MARIA's DMA, and what the score is worth


The simulation gave the game more CPU than hardware does, because it never
paid for MARIA's cycle stealing. `--dma-steal` charges it, using the cost
model in `dmabudget.py` -- including holey DMA, which matters enormously
here: Ballblazer's interrupt-bearing zones set the holey bit and keep their
graphics at `$1C00`, which bit 12 suppresses, so almost all of their apparent
cost is not paid at all. Modelling that took the charge from 12% of a frame
to 8%, and took `--dma-steal` from scoring 0.1% to scoring the same 6.3% as
without it.

**And then a more faithful version scored 0.1% again.** MARIA steals a
scanline at a time, not a zone at a time; spreading the identical total across
each zone's scanlines instead of charging it in one lump at the zone boundary
is unambiguously closer to the hardware, and it moves the score by a factor of
sixty. The two distributions differ by 17 cycles a frame out of 2,350.

That is the useful finding, and it is about the instrument rather than the
simulator: **the score is chaotic with respect to timing.** 6.3% does not mean
six per cent of the way there. It means a particular arrangement of a broken
simulation happens to keep 98 rows in step before drifting, and a small timing
change moves which rows those are. `--compare` can be trusted to say "not
trustworthy". It cannot be trusted to rank two near-misses, and it must not be
used to tune.

So `--dma-steal` stays off by default -- not because the default is more
correct, it is less, but because turning it on would trade a published number
for a worse one on the strength of a measure that cannot support the
comparison. The flag is there, it is the better physics, and the honest
position is that neither setting is close enough for the difference to mean
anything yet.

## What has been ruled out

Each of these was a confident diagnosis at some point, and each was wrong.

* **Display interrupts as the original blocker.** The first version of this
  file said Midnight Mutants' "timing comes from DLIs, not from the frame".
  Measured against hardware, that game raises **no display interrupts at
  all** -- twenty zones, not one with bit 7 set.
* **The BIOS.** The suspicion was that entering at the reset vector with RAM
  zeroed left a game reading state it never initialised. Disproven by the
  427,399 identical instructions: had inherited state mattered, the two would
  have parted company at once.
* **The mapper and the memory map.** Both agree with MAME on the vectors, on
  the code at the reset address, and now across most of half a million
  instructions of execution.
* **VBLANK phase.** The first divergence in the trace is a VBLANK wait, but it
  re-synchronises 1,160 instructions later, and sweeping the flag's phase
  across a whole frame changes the score by nothing.
* **The RIOT timer.** Neither game ever reads `INTIM`.
* ~~**POKEY reads.**~~ Recorded here as ruled out, on the grounds that
  "Ballblazer never reads it". That was wrong: it was measured over 300
  frames, and the music engine that reads `$400A` does not start until frame
  400. It was the bug. Left in place as a reminder that a negative result is
  only as good as the window it was measured over.
* **Double buffering of the display list.** The hypothesis was that the game
  keeps two lists and repoints MARIA mid-frame, so reading `DPPH`/`DPPL` once
  at frame start would read the wrong one. It does not: the pointer is
  written twice at frame 46 and once more at frame 404, and never within a
  frame.
* **A different display list.** Read out of MAME's memory at a matched frame,
  the game's list is byte-for-byte what this simulator has. An earlier claim
  that MAME ran 19 zone interrupts to this simulator's 16 is **withdrawn**:
  that reading came from tap-captured pointers, and the taps had died before
  the cartridge started, so it described the BIOS's display list.
* **Holey DMA.** Set in these zones, and measured to make drawing cheaper,
  not dearer -- so it cannot explain a cost that is too high.
* **RAM mirroring**, and **a crash through a null interrupt vector**: both
  were real faults, both are fixed, neither moved the score.

### A retraction

An earlier version of this file offered, as evidence that the two diverge
during initialisation, that MAME's display list sat at `$1F84` where this
simulator built one at `$26EE`. **That comparison was invalid.** `$1F84` is
written at MAME frame 16, and the cartridge does not get control until about
frame 133 -- so it is the BIOS's own display list, and the comparison was
against the logo screen rather than the game. The instruction-level diff,
which came later and is trustworthy, shows the two agreeing for 427,399
instructions instead.

A method note worth more than any of them: the useful signal was not the
"first divergence", which has now been misleading three times, but the SHAPE
of the 1,086 re-synchronisations that follow it -- almost all of them MAME
executing the same ~36 instructions this does not. That is a missing interrupt
handler, and it says so without needing a story.

Until `--compare` reports a high number, `capture.py` is the way to hear a
cartridge and this remains groundwork. See `docs/emulation.md`.

    of this simulator differing by 17 cycles a frame out of 2,350 scored 6.3%
    and 0.1%, which says nothing about either.

    The two questions are separated here.

      agreement  Of the states the simulation actually produced, how many are
                 the reference's, in the reference's order? This is "does the
                 player play the right notes".
      progress   How far into the reference did it get before it stopped or
                 wandered off? This is "does it keep playing".

    A simulation can be perfect on the first and hopeless on the second --
    Ballblazer is exactly that -- and the single number hid it.

    Matching is by longest common subsequence over the state values, so
    nothing depends on frame numbers, and timing is reported separately as
    the ratio of the gaps between matched events. Returns a dict.
