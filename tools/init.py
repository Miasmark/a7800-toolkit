"""
Start work on a cartridge: write the annotations file the disassembler reads.

    python tools/init.py game.a78 [-o annotations.json]

The first hour on a new game is always the same: read the header, find the
vectors, guess which bank is really mapped, run the disassembler, see how much
of it got reached. This does that once and writes down what it found, so the
file you edit starts with the facts already in it instead of an empty skeleton.

It records only what it can read off the cartridge -- vectors, mapper, chips,
banks. Everything it is unsure about is written as a note saying so rather than
as a guess, because a guess in an annotations file is indistinguishable from a
finding once it is on disk.
