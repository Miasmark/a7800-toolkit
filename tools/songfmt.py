"""
Pull a game's music out of its ROM, and push it back.

    python songfmt.py pull game.a78 -f formats/mm-tia.json -o songs.json
    python songfmt.py push game.a78 -f formats/mm-tia.json -i songs.json -o new.a78

No tool can guess a player's format, so this does not try: a format file says
what the bytes mean, and both directions fall out of that one description.
`audiotrace.py` finds the tables; the format file says how to read them.

## Why push is the hard half

Writing music back into a cartridge is not writing a file. The data sits in
whatever gaps the original author left, with other data hard against it, and
nothing announces where one ends and the next begins. Re-encoding a song a byte
longer than it was silently eats whatever followed.

So this is deliberately **in place and bounded**. Pull records the exact byte
span every element occupies. Push re-encodes into those same spans and refuses,
by name and by byte count, anything that no longer fits. After writing, it
compares the whole image against the original and fails if a single byte
outside the declared spans changed.

That is a narrow kind of editing -- you can change notes freely, but a pattern
cannot grow -- and the narrowness is the point. It is the difference between an
edit you can trust and one that appears to work until some unrelated thing
breaks.
