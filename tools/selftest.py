Run the toolkit against itself.

    python tools/selftest.py [--rom game.a78] [--format f.json] [--log capture.log]

Most of this runs with no cartridge at all, because the toolkit ships without
one: the example songs, the display-list decoder, the note tables, the cycle
table, the docs and the refusals are all self-contained. Point `--rom` at an
image and the round trips run too.

This exists because the regression was six commands typed from memory, and the
thing that slipped through was not a crash -- it was a number in the docs that
had quietly stopped being true. So the doc checks sit here alongside the code
checks, and they are not softer.

    Two bugs made this worth pinning down, and both were silent rather than

    missing operand as running off the end of the window -- so every trace
    stopped at the first INY and reported it as data. And the bank peephole
    (LDA #n / STA $D500) is what lets the tracer follow code into a paged bank
    at all; when it misses, the trace simply stays small and looks honest.

    So the fixture is a cartridge that requires both: it switches banks, then
    runs an implied instruction before touching anything. If either mechanism
    breaks, the reached-byte count collapses and the hardware list empties.

    It also checks that a register is named for what the instruction does to
    it. $D010 written is GRAFP; $D010 read is TRIG0. Reporting a button poll

    The whole reason floats exist is that a hardcoded address goes stale. This
    checks the blob lands inside the declared free run, that the byte after the
    run is untouched, and that the JSR operand which held a placeholder now
    holds the address actually chosen.

    **Two settings of one knob are refused.** Not applied in file order, which
    is what a plain stack of BPS files does, and which produces a ROM that is
    neither.

    **A header is carried through untouched.** The same body ships headered and
    bare; a bundle that only works on one of them is half a bundle.

    **Applying in two goes equals applying in one.** This is the claim that
    makes per-section checksums worth having: a ROM already patched elsewhere
    is still a valid target for an option whose own bytes nobody has touched.

def t_dist_carries_no_rom():
    """The published patches must not smuggle the cartridge out with them.

    `dist/` is the one directory in this repository that holds build output,
    and it holds it because both formats there are meant to travel without
    the game. That is a claim about bytes, so it is checked rather than
    believed -- the same standard `recipes carry no payload` holds
    `portkit.py` to.

    For a BPS the question is what its literals are. The encoder emits a
    literal only for a run that differs from the source, so in principle
    every stored byte is the patch author's; this confirms it by decoding
    each patch and comparing every literal against the original at the same
    address. One match would mean a byte of the game riding along.

    For the patch set the question is different, because it stores whole
    blobs. Its sections must describe their pre-image with a CRC32 and never
    quote it, and its float blobs -- code with no fixed home -- must be
    authored rather than lifted, so none of them may appear anywhere in the
    cartridge.

    Skips without a dump, like the other cartridge-dependent checks: with no
    original to compare against there is nothing to be sure of.
