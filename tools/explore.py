"""
Guess at a music format, listen to the guess, and adjust until it sings.

    python tools/explore.py game.a78 --at b6:A951
    python tools/explore.py game.a78            (starts from an audiotrace scan)

`audiotrace.py` finds where a cartridge keeps its music. Turning those bytes
into notes is the part no tool can do alone, because every player invents its
own layout. But it is also not something a person should do with a hex editor
and a pencil.

So this splits the job the way it wants to be split. **The machine proposes,
the ear disposes.** It reads a stretch of bytes, offers a set of plausible
readings of them, renders each one to audio, and lets you change the parameters
and listen again. Music is unmistakable when you hear it and invisible when you
stare at it, so the ear is the right instrument -- this just puts it within
reach.

## The two shapes worth trying first

**Serial**: one record per note, fields packed into consecutive bytes. Midnight
Mutants is like this -- two bytes a note, an instrument and duration in the
first, a waveform and pitch in the second.

**Parallel**: separate arrays, one for pitch and one for duration, advanced in
step. The player behind 58 images in the library is like this, and it looks
like noise if you read it as serial.

Neither is exotic and most players are one or the other, so trying both against
your ear costs a minute and settles it. When it sounds right, `--emit` writes
the format file that `songfmt.py` reads.

## What it does not claim

**It cannot tell music from anything else.** The ranking assumes you are
already pointed at music and guesses at the *layout*; asked to rank graphics
or 6502 code it answers just as confidently. That is not a bug to tune out.
The structural tests it leans on -- a repeating record size, streams that end
where each other begin -- detect *structure*, and MARIA cell data repeats
every 4 bytes while 6502 instructions average 3, so both score about as well
as a real tune does. Pointing it somewhere sensible is your job (audiotrace.py
does it by default), and rejecting a wrong reading is your ear's.

A reading that sounds right is a hypothesis, not a proof. Check it against
`tracker.py capture` of the same game before trusting it -- that records what
the cartridge actually plays, and if your reading and the machine disagree,
your reading is wrong. That is exactly how the two format files in `formats/`
were confirmed.

    it under the player's fingerprint so it is found again automatically.
