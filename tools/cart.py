"""
Atari 7800 cartridge images: the .a78 header, and the mappers it describes.

A 7800 cartridge is a window onto CPU address space, and which window depends on
the mapper. This module reads the header, picks a mapper, and gives the rest of
the toolkit one interface regardless:

    cart = Cart("game.a78")
    cart.spaces()                  -> ["f6", "b0", ..., "b7", "f7"]
    cart.space_of(0x8123, bank=3)  -> "b3"
    cart.byte("f6", 0x4000)        -> int
    cart.vectors()                 -> {"NMI": .., "RESET": .., "IRQ": ..}

A *space* is a name for one fixed view of ROM: "f6" and "f7" for regions that
never change, "b0".."b7" for the banks that take turns at a windowed region.
Addresses inside a space are CPU addresses, not file offsets, so a listing can
be read against a debugger without arithmetic.

Headerless dumps are accepted; the mapper is then guessed from the size, which
is right for linear ROMs and right for SuperGame only if the reset vector lands
in the last bank. Pass mapper= to override when the guess is wrong.

#   $2000  the Bankset test series         Bankset
#   $8000  files that name POKEY 800       POKEY at $0800
#
# Published bit lists disagree with this above bit 6 -- several put Activision
# at $0200 and Absolute at $0400. The cartridges say otherwise: F-18 Hornet is
# an Absolute-mapper game and its header reads $0200. Trust the images.
#
# Since confirmed against the canonical source: `a78header.asm` in
# 7800-devtools/a78_asm_header, the dasm include homebrew authors actually
# build their headers with. It agrees with the library on **every bit**,
# including the two the published lists get wrong, and it names the three that
# no image in the library exercises:
#
#   $0020  EXRAM/X2   hotspot banked RAM
#   $0080  EXRAM/A8   mirror RAM
#   $4000  EXRAM/M2   halt banked RAM
#
# Those three had been guesses here. Note they are RAM variants rather than
# mappers, which is why nothing broke while they were wrong.
