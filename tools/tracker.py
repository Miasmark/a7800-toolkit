"""
A tracker for the Atari 7800's TIA sound, and a way to hear what a cartridge
is already doing.

Every 7800 has two TIA audio channels, and each is three registers: AUDC picks
a waveform, AUDF divides the clock, AUDV sets the volume. That is the whole
instrument. This module models it accurately enough to render to a WAV, reads
and writes a plain-text tracker format, and turns a song into 6502 data.

Four things it does:

  python tracker.py notes                    what pitches the TIA can play
  python tracker.py render song.trk -o a.wav hear a song
  python tracker.py capture log.txt -o a.trk turn a MAME capture into a song
  python tracker.py export song.trk          6502 tables plus a player

`capture` is the one that pairs with the rest of the toolkit: `probes/audio.lua`
logs every AUDC/AUDF/AUDV write from any running 7800 game, and this turns that
log into an editable tracker file. That works on a cartridge whose music player
has not been reverse-engineered at all -- the register writes are the music,
whatever produced them.

## The chip, briefly

AUDF is **five bits**. Code often writes a whole byte and lets the chip discard
the top three, so a value read out of a ROM may need masking before it means
anything -- an unmasked byte plays about three times too low, which in the
polynomial voices drops below the range where a pitch is audible at all and
turns the voice into a tapping noise.

AUDC selects between pure dividers and polynomial counters (LFSRs). The pure
ones give the tones you can write melodies with; the polynomial ones give
buzzes and noise. AUDV is a 4-bit linear volume.

The TIA is not tuned to anything. Its pitches are `clock / ((AUDF+1) * divisor
* 2)`, which lands where it lands -- `notes` prints how far off each one is, in
cents, so a melody can be written around the notes that are actually close.

    volume nibble and has no AC content at all: 372 units per step, peak-to-peak
    zero. So it is held at full scale here and the mixer scales it by volume,
    which reproduces both cases correctly. A level that never changes is an
    inaudible offset, as on the chip; a level that changes every frame or two is
    the steps, which is the sample.
