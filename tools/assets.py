"""
Find a cartridge's music and artwork, and mark them up for the other tools.

    python tools/assets.py game.a78 [-c annotations.json]
        [--blocks out.json] [--manifest assets.json]

The disassembler tells you what is code. What is left is data, and data is not
one thing: it is graphics, music tables, text, and a lot of bytes nobody has
identified yet. Reading it as hex is the slow way to find out which.

This does what `audiotrace.py` does for sound, and the same trick for pictures.
Every store to a MARIA register is a place the hardware is being pointed at
something; trace back through straight-line code to whatever supplied the
address and you have found a display list, a character base, or a sprite table.
Then walk the display lists to the graphics they name.

What comes out:

  * `--blocks` writes annotation blocks, ready to merge into an annotations
    file, so the disassembler stops listing artwork as instructions and starts
    drawing it. Graphics blocks carry `"gfx": true`.
  * `--manifest` writes a description of every asset found, for the tools that
    work on assets rather than on listings -- `gfx.py` for a sprite sheet,
    `songfmt.py` for a song.

What it will not do is guess. An address that reaches a MARIA register is
evidence; a run of high-entropy bytes is not, and is reported as unidentified
rather than dressed up as a sprite. The confidence of every find is in the
output, and the ones that came from a display list are the ones to trust.

Some unidentified runs are unidentifiable on purpose. Homebrew commonly ships
artwork LZ4-compressed with `lz4raw`, which strips the header precisely so the
6502 does not have to parse one -- so there is no signature to match and the
target size lives in the code rather than the data. A run that looks like noise
and is never pointed at may be compressed rather than unused.
