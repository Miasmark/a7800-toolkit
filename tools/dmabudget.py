What MARIA leaves you: the 7800's cycle budget, for a given screen.

    python tools/dmabudget.py --uniform 12,16,4,8
    python tools/dmabudget.py --zone 16:2@8 --zone 16:6@16 --zone 16:0@0

MARIA draws by DMA and halts the 6502 while it does, so on the 7800 "how much
can my game compute" is a question about how much it is drawing. Every other
machine of the era lets you answer that from a manual; here the honest answer
was a shrug, so these numbers were measured.

HOW THEY WERE MEASURED
    A cartridge that spins a fixed-cost loop for the whole visible period and
    publishes the iteration count each frame. Build it once per display-list
    shape, change nothing but the display lists, and the difference in the
    count is the DMA cost. The loop was calibrated by running it again with
    extra NOPs: the fitted cost came out at 14.020 cycles per iteration
    against 14.016 counted by hand, and the measured window at exactly 241.0
    scanlines of 114.00 cycles.

HOLEY DMA, and what it is worth
    A zone can tell MARIA to suppress graphics fetches from part of memory, so
    one display-list entry can span a region that is mostly empty. The saving
    is large and now modelled: `h` on a zone. Measured, it is exactly the byte
    cost and nothing else -- the objects still pay for their display-list
    entries, and their pixels become free. Two 20-byte objects over 192
    scanlines went from 1,412 iterations a frame to 1,825, which is 0.753
    cycles a byte against the 0.744 charged here.

    Which addresses are suppressed was measured rather than looked up: with
    the 16K bit set, a fetch is dropped when **address bit 12 is set**
    ($D000 and $F000 free; $C000 and $E000 pay in full). The 8K bit made no
    difference anywhere in $C000-$FFFF, so this tool does not model it, and
    does not pretend to know what it does.

WHAT DOES NOT COST WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK
    Zone height does not matter: the same objects in 8-scanline and
    16-scanline zones cost within 0.2% of each other. Nor does where the
    graphics live -- fetching them from RAM measures identically to fetching
    them from ROM, to the iteration.

ACCURACY
    Typically well under 1%, and 1.5% at worst across the holey and
    display-interrupt cases added later. The one systematic error is on
    single-byte-wide objects, about 2.5%, where the linear model UNDER-states
    the cost -- so a screen full of very narrow objects reads optimistic.

    A caution about one number that is NOT in this model. Measuring
    Ballblazer's own screen off an emulator trace suggested MARIA was taking
    70.3 cycles a scanline where this predicts 39.6. That measurement is not
    trusted and no correction was made for it: the cycle total behind it
    under-counts taken branches, and it compared two runs that had already
    diverged. Every controlled test of the difference it blamed -- zone
    height, graphics in RAM, holey DMA, display interrupts -- came back
    showing the model right. If you find a real screen this under-states,
    that would be worth knowing; nothing here demonstrates one.

    Seventeen configurations were fitted (objects per zone, object width, zone
    count, zone height, 4- versus 5-byte entries), then the model was checked
    by PREDICTING four shapes it had never seen. All four landed within 0.3%.
    Worst residual anywhere: 56 cycles, which is 0.2% of a frame.

    These are MAME's timings. MAME's 7800 DMA model is good enough that the
    constants fall out as round numbers in MARIA colour clocks -- a graphics
    byte costs 2.98, which is the documented 3 -- but that is corroboration,
    not silicon.
